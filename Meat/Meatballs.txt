Ingredients:
- 1 onion (optional)
- 5 garlic cloves
- 3 or 4 slices of dry bread
- 600 g of ground meat (I used "hach√© de porc et boeuf")
- salt
- black pepper
- red paprika powder
- oil
- 1 egg
- breadcrumbs


Creating the mass:
1. Soak the dry bread in water (20 minutes are enough).
2. Mix it with the meat and the grated garlic, until it gets homogeneous.
3. Pour the salt, the pepper, the red paprika powder and the whole egg on top of the mass. Thoroughly mix them.
(4.) Now that we have the mass, it can be frozen so that later when lack of time, we can just defrost and fry it.
5. Form balls from the mass. I prefer smaller balls because the larger area/volume ratio makes it more crunchy.
   Sometimes I also put some cheese in their centres.
   Do not form perfect balls, rather slightly elongated ones, as they will change their shapes when fried.


Frying:
1. Cover the balls with breadcrumbs (remove the unnecessary particles as they burn in the oil).
2. Put oil to a pan so that it covers the balls by half of their diameters.
3. Preheat the oil.
4. Place the balls to the oil and use lower heat level to let the balls cook a bit.
5. Increase the heat intensity and fry the balls on one side and then the other.
